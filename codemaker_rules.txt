Select your code, and the computer will try and guess it.
Your code will consist of four colored pegs. You may select your pegs
from six colors: red, green, blue, purple, orange, or yellow. In order
to win, the computer must guess both the color and the position of all
four pegs. After each turn, the game will place a black peg to indicate
pegs that the computer has guessed correctly, and place a white peg to
indicate pegs where the computer has guessed the color but not the
location. This is both to show the computer how warm it's guesses are and
to show you how close the computer is getting! If it hasn't guessed
correctly by the 12th try, you win. Now choose your code!
